## üìö What I Learned
### What Is Machine Learning?
 > "Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." Arthur Samuel (1959).

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- Supervised Learning: Widely adopted in real-world applications, it has seen rapid innovation.
- Unsupervised Learning
- Recommender Systems
- Reinforcement Learning

## üß† Key Concepts
#### Supervised Learning
Training a learning algorithm involves teaching it to predict correct outputs by supplying pairs of input (X) and corresponding output (Y) values. After sufficient training, the algorithm should 
be capable of predicting output (Y) given only the input (X), resulting in accurate predictions.

#### Regression Algorithm 
Regression is a learning technique that predicts numerical values (Y) based on a given input (X). For example, it can be used to estimate house prices based on inputs like the suburb or city 
and the median sale prices in that location.

#### Classification Algorithm
A learning algorithm used to predict categorical outputs (e.g., cat vs. dog, good vs. bad, triangle vs. square, etc.). Based on input data, it determines which class or category the input most 
likely belongs to‚Äîoften represented using chosen symbols or labels. You can have two or more output categories; for example, to classify cats and dogs, the inputs might include features such as 
breed, color, size, or height.

#### Unsupervised Learning
A learning algorithm that only takes input(X), but no output labels, (Y). The goal is to discover hidden structure in the data, such as patterns, relationships, or groupings, without explicitly telling 
the algorithm what to look for. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning groups data based on similarities, also known as the clustering algorithm.

#### Clustering Algorithm
Clusters are groups of data points that share similar characteristics. For example, a search engine that uses unsupervised learning may group search results with similar content, 
such as matching keywords, spelling variations, or related descriptions (e.g., dog, cat, panda, elephant). Whether it‚Äôs an article, video, blog post, or webpage, the clustering 
algorithm will group content that falls within the bounds of those keywords.

#### Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
- Clustering
- Anommaly Detection
- Dimensionality Reduction
