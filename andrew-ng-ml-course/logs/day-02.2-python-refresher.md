# 📅 July 2 - 3, 2025 – Python Refresher
_Note: This learning path continues in /python-for-data-science-by-IBM/logs
## 🎯 Objective
To refresh core Python skills that will support my AI/ML journey, especially before diving deeper into Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course.

## 📘 Course: IBM – Python for Data Science, AI and Development

[Link to course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai)

## ✅ Topics Covered
- Python data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- Typecasting between data types
- Boolean conversion rules (`0 → False`, non-zero → True)
- Expressions and arithmetic operations
- Integer division using `//`
- Order of operations (BODMAS)
- Variables and assignment (`=`)
- Reassignment and variable memory reference behavior
- String fundamentals: syntax, immutability, indexing, slicing
- String operations: concatenation, replication
- Escape characters: `\n`, `\t`, `\\`
- Built-in string methods:
  - `.replace()`
  - `.find()`
  - `.upper()`, `.lower()`, etc.
- Using `len()` to get string length
- 🆕 **Introduction to Regular Expressions (RegEx)**
  - Pattern matching basics
  - Use cases: search, extract, validate string patterns

## 🔁 Reflection
This module was a helpful refresher on Python basics. While most topics were familiar, revisiting string immutability, slicing, 
and typecasting helped solidify my understanding. I also practiced core concepts like variable behavior, arithmetic operations, 
and built-in string methods. A key takeaway was the introduction to Regular Expressions (RegEx), which opened up new techniques 
for pattern matching and text validation—important tools for AI and data workflows.
