## 🧠 Reflection on Jupyter Notebook Segment

I reviewed the Jupyter Notebook content from the course, including its interface, cell execution, markdown usage, and kernel management.

Since I'm already familiar with using Jupyter through previous work in Python data analysis (using tools like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib), 
this section served more as a refresher than new learning. I was able to move through it efficiently without needing much repetition or lab time.

I recently completed a Data Analysis course at university, where I gained hands-on experience using Jupyter Notebook along with various data analysis libraries.

Additionally, the content covered in today’s lesson was material I had already encountered in past experiences. Instead of repeating what I already know, 
I used this opportunity to revisit core Python concepts to ensure I’m fully prepared for the more advanced material ahead.
