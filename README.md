📝 **July 1, 2025** – I decided to temporarily pause the Andrew Ng Machine Learning course to sharpen my Python skills by starting the IBM Python for Data Science, AI & Development course. I believe this will give me a stronger coding foundation before returning to ML.

📝 **July 12, 2025** – ⏸ Paused the IBM Python for Data Science, AI & Development course (7-day trial ended). Until I regain access, I’ll resume progress in the Andrew Ng Machine Learning Specialization.

📝 **July 18, 2025** - ⏸ Paused Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization due to upcoming university semester. Planning to resume after the term.
