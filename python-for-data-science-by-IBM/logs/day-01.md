## ðŸ“¦ Module 2: Python Data Structures â€“ Dictionaries & Sets 
### ðŸ“š Topics Covered
#### ðŸ“˜ Dictionaries
- Introduction to dictionaries and key-value data structures
- Creating, updating, and deleting entries
- Accessing values using keys (e.g., `my_dict['key']`)
- Nested dictionaries for complex data representation
- Common methods:
  - `.keys()` â€“ Returns all keys
  - `.values()` â€“ Returns all values
  - `.items()` â€“ Returns key-value pairs
  - `.get(key)` â€“ Safer access to values
#### ðŸ§® Sets
- Introduction to sets and their purpose in Python
- Set notation and characteristics (unordered, no duplicates)
- Converting lists to sets: `set(my_list)`
- Common methods:
  - `.add(item)` â€“ Add an element
  - `.remove(item)` â€“ Remove an element
- Mathematical operations:
  - `.union()` â€“ Combine two sets
  - `.intersection()` â€“ Common elements
  - `.issubset()` â€“ Check if one set is a subset of another
  - `&` â€“ Intersection operator (shorthand)

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts
#### Dictionaries
- Store data as key-value pairs.
- Are mutable and unordered.
- Useful for representing structured data such as JSON.
- Provide efficient access and modification using keys.

#### Sets
- A collection type similar to lists and tuples.
- Do not allow duplicate elements â€” duplicates are automatically removed.
- Can store elements of different data types.
- Are unordered and do not support indexing or slicing.

### ðŸªž Reflection
While I was already familiar with the Python syntax, many of the dictionary and set methods were new to me. 
What stood out in particular was how sets can be compared using mathematical concepts like Venn diagrams,
and how methods such as .intersection() and .union() allow for intuitive comparison of set elements. 
This connection between abstract math and real Python operations made the topic both practical and engaging.
